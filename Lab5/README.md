# Code Generation

Unfortunately this lab wasn't finished on time. For the code generation one of the designs that I have decided on was using every arithmetic and boolean expression as a C variable counter which increments after every generation. These get parsed around as ints to which every boolean and expression gets generated at every step. No code optimisation was implemented.
